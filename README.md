# Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains assignments related to machine learning, covering a range of topics from data pre-processing to implementing advanced algorithms. 

## Course Objectives
1. Data pre-processing and visualization using statistical methods.
2. Implement machine learning concepts and algorithms in a suitable programming language.
3. Study and understand machine learning algorithms.

## Course Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will:
- Analyze and pre-process large datasets for machine learning.
- Implement and evaluate supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction).
- Design and execute machine learning experiments for real-world problems.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Assignments
